              <p>This project was the initiative of four members of the CS Association of Nepal, a student
                organization whose underlying philosophy is to use computer science to solve the real-world
                issues.</p><br />
              <p>We consider it a great honor. It is a rare opportunity for us to use our skills and knowledge for
                such a noble cause. We strongly believe that this is a milestone for us. The CS Association
                family expresses their deepest gratitude towards Blind Youth Association Nepal for their belief
                and support.</p> <br />
