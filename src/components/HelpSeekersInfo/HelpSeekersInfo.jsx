          <p>First and foremost, a warm welcome to you. This platform was especially created to facilitate you in your
            exam. You have two options. Remember these options may not always be available.
            The availability of assistance depends on a lot of factor: your geographic location, time, and even
            money sometimes. The 1st option avails you with a volunteer who will help you in the exam for free of
            cost. If such volunteers are available, it is icing on the cake for you. Even if this option is
            unavailable, we recommend you to look for option two as you may find assistance at an affordable cost.
            We also recommend you to contact the helpers and negotiate. <br /><br />

            To connect with helpers, click on the link below. This will ask you for minor details about you, what
            kind of help you want (voluntary or payment-based), the date and time of help needed and the area where
            you need assistance.</p>
