          <h1>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h1>
          <p>Helping in general is a very noble act. It shows your kind and compassionate nature. But, helping people with disabilities
            in their educational endeavors and journey is a much greater deed. If you
            want to be a part of this initiative and experience the treserous feeling that comes with helping others, we would love to express
            our warm welcome. There are two options for you: voluntary help or help via a small payment. We highly encourage you to provide voluntary
            help, and if you prefer the latter option, we urge you to offer assistance in exchange for the least payment. <br /><br />

            To connect with help seekers, click on the link below. This will ask you for minor details about you and the area where you can offer your
             assistance. <br/>
